Hi there, I am Giulio! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently working as R&D Engineer at [ABB](https://global.abb/group/en) in Quartino, Switzerland.

Prior to this, I pursued a Master's degree in Data Science at the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en), Italy. During my studies, I had the opportunity to work as ML Engineer Intern at [ABB](https://global.abb/group/en) in Mannheim, Germany, and as Research Intern under the supervision of Prof. Elisa Ricci in the Deep Visual Learning (DVL) research unit of [Fondazione Bruno Kessler](https://www.fbk.eu/en) in Trento, Italy. 

During my time at [FBK](https://www.fbk.eu/en), I conducted research in the field of domain adaptation to improve the performance of object detection models, and the work I've done ended up in a paper being accepted at WACV 2023. If you are interested, you can find the paper [`here`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11539)!

In my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar, doing sports (such as football, basketball, running, and the list goes on), playing chess and hiking.
