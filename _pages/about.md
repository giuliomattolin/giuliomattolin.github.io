Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en), Italy. On top of that, at the moment I'm also working as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at [ABB](https://global.abb/group/en) in Mannheim, Germany. 

In addition, during 2021/2022 I've had the opportunity to work as a Research Intern in the Deep Visual Learning (DVL) research unit of [Fondazione Bruno Kessler](https://www.fbk.eu/en), Italy. In this period, I conducted research in the field of domain adaptation to improve the performance of object detection models, and the work I've done ended up in a paper being accepted at WACV 2023. If you are interested, you can find the paper [`here`](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11539)!

In my spare time, I enjoy playing guitar, doing sports (such as football, basketball, running, and the list goes on), playing chess and hiking.
